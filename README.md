# Scriptoria - Mini Content Management System

A Laravel-based multi-author content management system built for the Laravel Developer Assessment. This CMS allows writers to create articles, submit them for review, and admins to approve or reject submissions.

## Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Laravel Breeze** authentication with Blade templates
- **Custom middleware** for role-based route protection (`IsAdmin`, `IsWriter`)
- **Automatic login activity tracking** with IP addresses and timestamps
- **Event-driven security auditing** for all authentication actions

### Content Management
- **Article creation and management** with draft/review workflow
- **Status-based article lifecycle**: Draft ‚Üí Pending Review ‚Üí Published/Rejected
- **Writer dashboard** to manage personal articles
- **Admin dashboard** for reviewing pending submissions

### Technical Features
- **Modern PHP 8.1+ Enums** for type-safe status management
- **Professional traits** for database transactions and API responses
- **Comprehensive Eloquent relationships** and query optimization
- **Public REST API** for published articles
- **Event-driven architecture** with `ArticleSubmitted` events and logging
- **Custom middleware** for role-based authorization
- **Automatic security auditing** with login activity tracking

## ÔøΩ Authentication & Authorization

### Middleware Protection
- **`IsAdmin`**: Protects admin-only routes (`/admin/*`)
  - Verifies user authentication and admin privileges
  - Returns 403 error for non-admin users
  - Redirects to login for unauthenticated users

- **`IsWriter`**: Protects writer-only routes (`/articles/*`)
  - Ensures user has writer privileges (non-admin)
  - Maintains separation between admin and writer functions

### Event-Driven Security
- **Login Activity Tracking**: Automatically logs all user logins
  - Records IP address, timestamp, and user information
  - Enables security auditing and monitoring
  - Integrates with Laravel's built-in `Login` event

- **Article Submission Events**: Logs article review submissions
  - Triggers when writers submit articles for review
  - Creates audit trail for content workflow
  - Custom `ArticleSubmitted` event with detailed logging

## ÔøΩüóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### Users Table
- `id`, `name`, `email`, `password`
- `is_admin` (boolean, default: false)
- `email_verified_at`, `remember_token`, `timestamps`

### Articles Table
- `id`, `user_id` (foreign key), `title`, `content`
- `status` (enum: draft, pending_review, published, rejected)
- `timestamps` with performance indexes

### Login Activities Table
- `id`, `user_id` (foreign key), `ip_address`
- `login_at` (timestamp), `timestamps`

  - No authentication required
  - JSON format with standardized response structure

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Enums

- **`ApiResponses`**: Standardized JSON response formatting
- **`ApiExceptionHandler`**: Centralized error handling for APIs

### Models & Relationships
```php
User::class
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hasMany(Article::class)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ hasMany(LoginActivity::class)

Article::class
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ belongsTo(User::class)

LoginActivity::class
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ belongsTo(User::class)
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing
